> Note: This lab is OPTIONAL and is meant to be *very* challenging. This is an opportunity to really push yourself and practice working with tough documentation.

## Exercise

In this lab, you will be using [Google's Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/) to create an email app!

The app should have an inbox and a way of viewing the email's contents. The app should also account for tablet devices.

Before you get started, definitely take a look at the [Android Quickstart Guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/android).

Although, the requirement is to "build an email client app," the design and functionality of the app is yours to choose! For instance, [Google's Inbox](https://www.google.com/inbox/) app is an email client, but they added one-click functionality that makes it easy to empty the inbox of unnecessary emails. As long as your app allows you to list a user's emails and view the contents of the emails, feel free to add-on to further challenge yourself.

*Note*: We suggest using Google's Gmail API. However, points will not be taken away if you use another API to access a user's email. So, if you find another API that you find easier to use, or more straight forward, then go ahead!

#### Requirements

Your email client must show/do the following:

* A list of emails in a user's inbox
* A screen for viewing the contents of an email that is seen when clicking an item in the list of emails
* On tablets, in landscape, both the master list of emails in the inbox and the details of a selected email should be visible
  * You should use a master/detail layout!
* Be able to compose and send emails
* Must use a class, like _Email.java_, that defines the email objects

**Bonus**:

Though not required, try to aim for the following goals:

* Use material design
* Add a way to save drafts of emails
* Add a way to search emails
* Add functionality where you can select different accounts and view their emails

#### Deliverable

A pull request with your app that meets the above requirements. Here are a few screenshots of the Gmail app for inspiration:
